## Apple Reminders ReadLater Script

This script taps into *OSASCRIPT*, Apple-script to connect the Command-Line to
Apple's Native applications. The ReadLater script saves a title + description
into a predefined Reminders List.


Coming Features:
- Comma Separation instead of having to wrap the parameters into quotation
  marks. 
- Ability to choose a Reminders List before saving
- Ability to log/save all entries made using this tool (non-urgent due to
  built-in ability within reminders app to retrieve completed tasks)
